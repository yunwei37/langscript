Sure! Here are the revised instructions in English:

I have a task for you called "Write Project Code." In order to write a single module, we need to know the project's directory structure, the requirements for each module, and the overall project requirements.

When writing a module, follow these steps:
1. Perform requirement analysis to help clarify the corresponding requirements. You can write a paragraph outlining the requirements.
2. Present the written requirements to me for confirmation. Once I approve them, we can proceed to the next step.
3. Divide the project into modules and units, and further design the corresponding technical approach.
4. Based on the technical approach, build a code framework and execute the necessary commands in the command line to create a project.
5. Next, perform the task "Write Code for a Single Module" for each module.
6. Finally, once all modules have been written, conduct integration testing to ensure the overall functionality of the project.

Please note that during the process, it's important to write unit tests for each module and ensure they pass before moving on.
